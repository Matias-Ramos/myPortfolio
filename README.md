### Challenges on this project

This is an open source project. It was great to work on someone elses code and being able to work on it as if I were the one who wrote it. Here are the main changes I made to the project: 

- Responsiveness was fixed for every viewport.

- Code readability was highly improved by using arrow function components with implicit return and tailwind styles outside of the components.

- New functionalities were added, such as the implementation of an OffCanvas component (also called Drawer) in the "/work" section, the hoverable devIcons, and making the form actually work.

- Good code practices were implemented, such as:

    - Replacement of unnecessary div tags with semantic HTML tags ;

    - The elements were mostly positioned absolutely with pixel-specific values, which isn't optimal for different viewports. Instead, I changed the behaviour of the layout by implementing in its majority an ordered renderization of relative-positioned components ;

    - Keyboard accesibility was implemented ;

    - Large and complex components were broken down into smaller, more manageable ones ; 

    - The disorganized "components" directory was restructured into separate folders for each section's components ;

    - UX/UI improvements were made, such as adding left/right arrows and navigation to carousels for intuitive user interaction ;
